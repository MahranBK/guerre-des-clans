## Technical Implementation Details

### Action System Architecture
The game implements a state-based action system where each action (Attack, Defend, Move, Power) is managed through event handlers and state controllers. Here's how each action works behind the scenes:

#### Move Action Logic
- The system maintains a grid-based coordinate system where each cell has x,y coordinates
- When Move is selected:
  1. The system calculates valid movement tiles based on:
     - Unit's movement range
     - Terrain obstacles
     - Other unit positions
  2. Valid cells are highlighted using a pathfinding algorithm
  3. Movement validation checks:
     - Ensures destination is within range
     - Verifies path is not blocked
     - Confirms unit hasn't moved this turn
  4. After movement, unit's position is updated in the game state

#### Attack Action Implementation
- Attack logic uses a range-based targeting system:
  1. Target validation:
     - Checks if target is within unit's attack range
     - Verifies line of sight (for archers)
     - Confirms target is an enemy unit
  2. Damage calculation considers:
     - Base damage of attacking unit
     - Target's defense value
     - Random variance (¬±10% of base damage)
     - Critical hit chance (15% chance for 1.5x damage)
     - Defensive stance multipliers
  3. Post-attack processing:
     - Updates target's health
     - Triggers any counter-attack mechanics
     - Updates UI to reflect changes
     - Marks attacking unit as "acted"

#### Defense System Mechanics
- Defensive stance implementation:
  1. When activated:
     - Unit's defense value increases by 50%
     - Adjacent friendly units get 25% defense bonus
     - System tracks defensive buff duration
  2. Defense calculation:
     - Base defense + Stance bonus + Adjacent allies bonus
     - Maximum stack of 3 adjacent defensive bonuses
  3. State management:
     - Defensive buffs persist until unit's next turn
     - System tracks which units are in defensive stance
     - Updates visual indicators accordingly

#### Special Power System
- Each unit type has unique power implementation:
  1. Warrior's Contre-Attaque:
     - System stores damage received
     - Calculates 50% reflection value
     - Applies reflected damage to attacker
     - Tracks cooldown (3 turns)
  
  2. Archer's Tir Pr√©cis:
     - Temporarily modifies damage calculation formula
     - Bypasses 50% of target's defense
     - Increases hit chance to 100%
     - Manages 4-turn cooldown
  
  3. Mage's Explosion de Feu:
     - Area damage calculation:
       * Primary target: 100% damage
       * Adjacent cells: 75% damage
       * Diagonal cells: 50% damage
     - Handles multiple target damage application
     - 5-turn cooldown management

#### Turn Management System
- Turn controller manages:
  1. Action state tracking:
     - Which units have acted
     - Available actions per unit
     - Cooldown timers
  2. Turn transition processing:
     - Resets unit action flags
     - Updates cooldowns
     - Removes expired buffs
     - Triggers turn-based effects
  3. Victory condition checking:
     - Scans for defeated units
     - Validates win conditions
     - Triggers game end if conditions met

### State Management
- The game uses a centralized state manager that:
  1. Tracks game state:
     - Unit positions
     - Health values
     - Active effects
     - Turn counter
  2. Handles state updates:
     - Validates actions
     - Updates unit states
     - Manages turn transitions
  3. Maintains action history for:
     - Undo functionality
     - Combat log
     - Game statistics

### Event System
- The game implements an event-driven architecture:
  1. Action events:
     - Movement completion
     - Attack resolution
     - Ability activation
  2. State change events:
     - Unit health updates
     - Position changes
     - Buff application/removal
  3. Turn events:
     - Turn start/end
     - Phase transitions
     - Game end conditions

This technical architecture ensures smooth gameplay flow while maintaining game balance and proper rule enforcement. Each action and state change is validated and processed through multiple layers of logic to ensure game integrity and consistent behavior.
